            Hey there, fellow developers, hackers and geeks, my name is Anda Toshiki romanized form Japanese Kanji of
            ÂÆâÁî∞‰øäÊ®π originated from my Japanese name. Alternatively, you could refer me as kiki as a nickname in a
            short substitute (the same name as the protagonist Majo from Kiki's Delivery Service by Hayao Miyazaki). I'm
            the cutest yet most moe developer Majo Shoujo whom she watches anime, drinks monster, writes codes,
            documents tutorials, takes photos, eats burgers and pulls up all-nighters!

            Allow and forgive me for the redundant introduction yet again, I am Anda Toshiki, pronounced as
            <code>AHN-dah TOH-shee-kee</code> in case you perceive my name obscure to articulate. I am a current
            undergraduate Sun Devil (ASU students are called Sun Devils as a nod to the university's mascot) at Arizona
            State University majored concurrently in Business & Finance B.A. at

            Shikiology @shikiology aiming for a better technological pursuit and open-source spiritual virtue, and
            additionally I am maintaining the community with both of my feline companion kitties üò∫ (Áéâ„Å°„ÇÉ„Çì & Ê°É„Å°„ÇÉ„Çì

            I am utterly passionate yet unwavering in my dedication to establishing a harmonious balance between
            technological advancement and spiritual enlightenment, striving to inspire others to join me on this
            transformative journey towards a brighter and more connected future whilst abiding intimately with the the

            I'm not the type of individual whom they eagerly vying for their rights for personal identification
            pronounces, he/him is preferably appreciated for avoiding dramatic disputes during physical meetups or
            trysts. I was originally born and bred in a trilingual family with a biracial ethnicities of Japanese and
            Chinese, meanwhile exposed to a pure yet immersive multifaceted American Christianity culture as educational
            environment since born. I, hence, am native in English and Japanese meanwhile proficient in Chinese with a
            linguistic proficiency certification beyond HSK (level VI). You are absolutely welcomed and do not hesitate
            to contact me with any of the language you are most comfortable to communicate in with, please refer to
            contacts page for a relatively complete means of contacts though email via hello@toshiki.dev is personally
            favored. I'm currently learning Espa√±ol as one of the second-most widely spoken language in the world to fit
            the demands of writing Spanish oriented documentation for better i18n practices with accuracies and
            grammatical credibilities. (Well, with regard to my abject procrastinative virtue as an INTP striving
            through a sustained phase of transformation into INTJ, perhaps it frankly will dwell a while before I
            initiate my action).

            The primary focal interests of my developmental pursuits are the obsession with automation and self-hosted
            open source alternatives for all type of proprietary softwares. The triumph of successfully configuring a
            local project and deploying them to actual production stage for private employment is undoubtedly hard to
            vividly describe with just a feel lines of words, but as of now, I have established approximately 300
            applications established under my local LAN environment on NAS with practical usages that serves my daily
            needs to alleviate the processes of workloads. Computer networking is yet an fascinating field of skilled
            essentials which allowing me to orchestrate and inaugurate a interdependent ecosystem to transform
            individual applications from isolated tools to a cohesive and powerful automated ecosystem, despite the
            field of expertise still remains as a flower on the high ridge for me to exert more researches and efforts
            to ensure the grasps of full knowledges whilst I am still maintaining a sustenance of progressive learning.
            I also managed to learn and research on SysAdmin in addition with DevOps as affiliated benefits throughout
            active exploring and constant developing.

            Leaving aside a tediously laborious personal historic background autobiography, time to start on fun facts
            about myself. I have a severe sense of collectomania or hoarding habits for a diverse types of data even if
            I barely read through any of them instead just let them sit in my hard drives rather XD. I have intermediate
            experience with photography editing with both PhotoShop and Illustrator and have been using both tools on
            daily bases to commit minor edits on photos to level of perfections; I am also interested in photography, I
            records everything aesthetics in life with cameras and showcase them at my

                >web gallery</a
            >. I do spare my time by immersively soaking myself into the realm of anime, which is my indefinite virtual
            oasis at leisure to delve into fantastical worlds and narratives that ignite my imagination and provide a
            much-needed escape from the rigors of reality, and my favorite anime by far is "DanMachi"
